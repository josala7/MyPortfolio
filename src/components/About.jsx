        <p>
           I recently graduated with a degree in a Computer Science departement from faculty of science in Alexandria university, building a strong foundation in programming, algorithms,
           and problem-solving. Passionate about web development, I enjoy blending design and functionality to create intuitive digital experiences.
           Now, as a Wordpress Developer,
           Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills and creativity to crafting seamless and engaging user interfaces.
